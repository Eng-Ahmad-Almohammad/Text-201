# Text
## Specifying Typefaces (font-family)
### The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies. The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use. 
## Size of Type (font-size)
### The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:
### 1-*pixels*: are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.
### 2-*percentages*: The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.
### 3- *Ems*: An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
