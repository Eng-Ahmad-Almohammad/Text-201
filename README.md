## Specifying Typefaces (font-family)
### The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies. The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use. 
## Size of Type (font-size)
### The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:
### 1-*pixels*: are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.

### 2-*percentages*: The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.

### 3- *Ems*: An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.

## More Font Choice (@font-face)
### @font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.

## Bold (font-weight)
### The font-weight property allows you to create bold text. There are two values that this property commonly takes:
- [x] normal: This causes text to appear at a normal weight.

- [x] bold: This causes text to appear bold.

## Italic (font-style)
### If you want to create italic text, you can use the font-style property. There are three values this property can take:
### 1-normal: This causes text to appear in a normal style (as opposed to italic or oblique)

### 2- italic: This causes text to appear italic.

### 3- oblique: This causes text to appear oblique.

## Alignment (text-align)
### The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text. The property can take one of four values:
### 1- left: This indicates that the text should be left-aligned.

### 2-right: This indicates that the text should be right-aligned.

### 3- center: This allows you to center text.

### 4- justify: This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.
